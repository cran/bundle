Description: Typically, models in 'R' exist in memory and can be saved via
    regular 'R' serialization. However, some models store information in 
    locations that cannot be saved using 'R' serialization alone. The goal of 
    'bundle' is to provide a common interface to capture this information, 
    situate it within a portable object, and restore it for use in new settings.
